## Basic Overview

A Software used to scrape data from [Nist](https://www.nist.gov/), [Chemeo](https://www.chemeo.com/) and [Pubchem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to format chemical properties in csv form originally as a study for organic compounds and its partition coefficient, to see if we could use a deepforest algorithm to predict other following reactions.

## About Chemcell
N/A

## Implementation

```
pip install chemcell
```

## Usage
Getting a bulk dataset including a specific element while modifying what is tabulated from Sites Pubchem, Chemeo and referencing Nist's handy reaction list.
```
from chemcell import Chc
example = Chc("Hcl", Outlier=False, "file_source").range(5,20)
data = example.tabulate()
```
For self study and educational purposes, general Ml predictions et al.
